Run SharpieCubeFinder.py or SharpieCubeFinderNoName.py if you only want to search card's rules & flavour text, Windows executables can be found in the corrosponding folders (they should work?)

Enter the text/characters you want to search for in a card's name (don't worry about spaces, not case-sensitive)

Enter the text/characters you want to search for in a card's combined rules & flavour text (don't worry about spaces, not case-sensitive)

all matching cards will be displayed in terminal & saved to a seperate text file output.txt
